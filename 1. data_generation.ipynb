This revelation explained how genetic information could be stored, copied, and passed down through generations. Their model showed that DNA consists of two strands of nucleotides coiled around each other, held together by base pairs adenine-thymine and guanine-cytosine. The discovery earned Watson, Crick, and Maurice Wilkins the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, though Franklin's crucial contributions went unrecognized due to her death from cancer in 1958 and the Nobel Committee's rules against posthumous awards.\n",
